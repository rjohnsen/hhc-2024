After solving the last objective, I had to travel back to Santa in the courtyard to have a chat with him:

But no. He had not that much interesting to say. I noticed there were some yellow thingy behind him. I hurried over.

The yellow marking was a sign to enter the building. Inside the building I saw Santa standing there. Apparently he is a fast mover since he was out in the courtyard a couple of seconds ago.

After a bit of chit chat, the end credits rolled and the games was thus over for this year!

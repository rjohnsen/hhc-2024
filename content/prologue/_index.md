Jingle Ringford (Frosty's Beach)

> Welcome to the Geese Islands and the 2023 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge!
> 
> I'm Jingle Ringford, one of Santa's many elves.

> ...
> 
> Just kidding! It's actually the 2024 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge!
> 
> And although we're on Frosty's Beach on Christmas Island, we'll soon be on our way back to the North Pole.
> 
> I thought it best to wait here for people that heard we're on the Geese Islands but may not know we're leaving.
> 
> I haven't seen Santa since we started packing up, but he always asks me to give a quick orientation to newcomers, so I'm continuing the tradition.
> 
> Before you head out any further onto the island, you need to accomplish two simple tasks.
> 
> But first, here's a parting gift. I packed this snowball made of the magical, never-melting snow of Christmas Island. A little souvenir to take with you when we leave for the North Pole.

> As the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge approaches each year, a sense of excitement and anticipation builds within me. For me, this challenge has become a highly anticipated tradition, one that I take so seriously that I set aside vacation time specifically to immerse myself in it. Each year, I look forward to solving complex puzzles, exploring new challenges, and competing alongside some of the brightest minds in cybersecurity. The journey is always one of growth and learning, filled with moments of both frustration and triumph. This event isn’t just about winning—it's about pushing the limits of our knowledge, sharpening our skills, and enjoying the thrill of the challenge. I’m ready to dive in once again and can’t wait to see what this year holds.

>This report reflects my experience and learnings from this year’s edition. I have put a lot of effort into compiling and sharing the insights, challenges, and victories I encountered, and I hope it adds value to the community. Let the adventure begin!

    <title>Closing - HHC 2024</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/closing/index.html</link>
    <description>After solving the last objective, I had to travel back to Santa in the courtyard to have a chat with him:&#xA;But no. He had not that much interesting to say. I noticed there were some yellow thingy behind him. I hurried over.&#xA;The yellow marking was a sign to enter the building. Inside the building I saw Santa standing there. Apparently he is a fast mover since he was out in the courtyard a couple of seconds ago.</description>
